In this project, I created a set of base models to be fine-tuned to predict a user's distance running race time from their Strava history.

In this project, I conducted Exploratory Data Analysis, feature engineering from Kaggle dataset (link), applying data cleaning, data mining, transforming and scaling

deep but simple neural networks

achieved 97% accuracy on race time prediction
